  You’ll join once for each project that needs funding. It’s pretty quick, as
  long as you have:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-12">
  <li class="mb-2">
    <strong>A fund wallet:</strong>
    the Filecoin wallet you’re ready to accept funds at for the project. Using the
    same wallet for multiple projects is okay!
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <strong>A small amount of FIL:</strong>
    to join the Fund Ring, you need to deploy a contract, which will incur network
    fees.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <strong>Metamask Desktop or Brave Browser:</strong>
    your wallet needs to be set up in one of these, in order to be able to connect
    to the Fund Ring app.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Write access to your git repo:</strong>
    if you don’t have write access to your repo, please forward this setup form to
    someone who does. It also needs to be public, in order to qualify.
  </li>
</ul>
